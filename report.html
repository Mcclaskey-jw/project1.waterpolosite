    <ul>
        <li>The audience for my website is for anyone who is looking to join or just learn more about the JMU men's club water polo team.</li>
        <li>All the pictures were taken by players or parents of players and sent in our team group chat, and all the text was written by me.</li>
        <li>My site has 5 pages a home, team, tournament, practice, and an apply page.</li>
        <li>Can see the header at the top of every page</li>
        <li>Can see the navigation links at the top of every page.</li>
        <li>I have a media query when the size of the page gets/is to small I drop the JMU logo to leave space for the nav links and all the divs should be auto spaced.</li>
        <li>I used the color pallet posted by JMU to maintain a coherent style.</li>
        <li>Most pictures come with a description and specific ids.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>The site uses text center to center the everything to the middle of the screen.</li>
        <li>All text boxs are given a padding to prevent text bleeding.</li>
        <li>I use two different header styles on most pages.</li>
        <li>The Apply page contains a form for people to apply to the team.</li>
        <li>There are mutiple links to our JMU page, to the CWPA page, and our donation page.</li>
        <li>I beilieve I have followed the proper naming convention.</li>
        <li>I have an animation on the pracitce page to make it look like someone is shooting on the goal.</li>
        <li>My code is saved at https://github.com/Mcclaskey-jw/project1.waterpolosite</li>
        <li>It auto redirects you to the HTTPS version of the site when you try to go through HTTP.</li>
