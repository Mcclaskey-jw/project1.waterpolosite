    <title>JMU Men's Club Water Polo Team</title>
</head>

<body>
    <ol>
        <li>The audience for my website is for anyone who is looking to join or just learn more about the JMU men's club
            water polo team.</li>
        <li>All the pictures were taken by players or parents of players and sent in our team group chat, and all the
            text was written by me.</li>
        <li>My site has 5 pages a home, team, tournament, practice, and an apply page.</li>
        <li>Can see the header at the top of every page</li>
        <li>Can see the navigation links at the top of every page.</li>
        <li>I have a media query when the size of the page gets/is to small I drop the JMU logo to leave space for the
            nav links and all the divs should be auto spaced.</li>
        <li>I used the color pallet posted by JMU to maintain a coherent style.</li>
        <li>Most pictures come with a description and specific ids.</li>
        <li>I tried to prevent all warnings and error but it keeps saying button element cant be a descendant of an "a"
            element but every configuration I could switch too or even flipping them still gives and error so give me my
            point deduction and let me know how to fix this in the future. Google said just put a form in between to fix
            this but it didnt help.</li>
        <li>The site uses text center to center the everything to the middle of the screen.</li>
        <li>All text boxs are given a padding to prevent text bleeding.</li>
        <li>I use two different header styles on most pages.</li>
        <li>The Apply page contains a form for people to apply to the team.</li>
        <li>There are mutiple links to our JMU page, to the CWPA page, and our donation page.</li>
        <li>I beilieve I have followed the proper naming convention.</li>
        <li>I have an animation on the pracitce page to make it look like someone is shooting on the goal.</li>
        <li>My code is saved at https://github.com/Mcclaskey-jw/project1.waterpolosite</li>
        <li>It auto redirects you to the HTTPS version of the site when you try to go through HTTP.</li>
        <li>I have HTTPS so done.</li>
        <li>It does redirect you.</li>
        <li>There is a steady flow of commits starting from Monday.</li>
        <li>YOU ARE HERE!!!!</li>
